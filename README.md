# Group-Project-Final-Video

As the director of a small group, we created the follow animated short within 6 weeks. My main resposibilites aside from directing were Character modeling, FX, Lighting and Layout. For FX, I worked on the disintegration effect in Houdini and created this growing grass that eventually got cut from the final production. I've also included an individual contribution PDF that I created for the assignment, and have linked the video of the grass growing effect below.
